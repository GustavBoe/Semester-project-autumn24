          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
          displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes
          of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly
          lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
          for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
          contact us if you&#39;d like to find out more about how you can get
          involved.
