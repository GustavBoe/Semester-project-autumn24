          <p>There are various ways you can support the museum.</p>
          <p>
            Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this
            museum open and accessible to the whole community.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also support us by donating items of interest to the
            museum&#39;s collections.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have some item or collection that you think others would
            enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department
            and they will be able to assist you.

            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
            contact us if you&#39;d like to find out more about how you can get
            involved.
